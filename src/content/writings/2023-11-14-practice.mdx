Making impact maps is a skill that requires practice. Ideally, the goal for a project is known upfront, so the impact map is developed in order: goal, then actors, then impacts, then deliverables, then experiments.

However, sometimes the goal is initially unclear. Stakeholders may have an easier time describing a solution that could solve their problem than describing the problem itself.

The following two exercises will help form an impact map, regardless of the project's starting point:

- [Make an impact map](#exercise-make-an-impact-map)
- [Discover the goal](#exercise-discover-the-goal)

## Exercise: Make an impact map

Properly formulating a goal can hinder the work of just diving in and developing an impact map. For this exercise, select a goal from the following list, then make an impact map from that goal.

### Step 1: Select a goal

Select a goal from a predefined list.

If conducting this exercise with a group, consider using [dot voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting) to select the goal. In the following examples, a `+` indicates one vote, and a <mark>highlighted</mark> item indicates the group's selection based on the votes.

<Figure label="Example goals">
1. Run a 5km road race in the next three months. `++++`
1. Help my family eat more nutritious food this year. `+++`
1. Limit my shower usage to under seven minutes a day for two weeks. `+`
1. Make two new soups this month. `+++`
1. <mark>Visit a national park this year with my family.</mark> `+++++`
1. Volunteer one day a month at a non-profit, for the next six months. `+`
1. Grow and harvest a tomato plant this season. `++++`
1. Read a book a month this year. `+++`
1. Play a round of disc golf at each course in town this year.
1. Learn to identify six native bird species this year. `+++`
1. Start a sharing library (of things) in my neighborhood this year. `+++`
1. Increase attendance and participation at the local library by 5% over the next six months. `++`

### Step 2: Select actors

Each participant should spend 5 minutes making a list of actors (individuals, groups, or systems). Ask:

> Who can help or hinder achieving the goal?

Come together as a group and share the lists. Use dot voting to select one to three actors for the next step.

<Figure label="Example actors">
- National Park Service `+`
- Park visitors
- Park guide
- <mark>My family</mark> `++++`
- Transportation
- <mark>Myself</mark> `+++++`
- Weather
</Figure>

### Step 3: Select impacts

Each participant should spend 5 minutes making a list of impacts (behavior changes) for each of the selected actors in Step 2. Ask:

> What should the actors do or not do to impact the goal?

Come together as a group and share the lists. Use dot voting to select one to three impacts for the next step.

<Figure label="Example impacts by actor">
My family:
- <mark>Be motivated and excited.</mark>
- Identify a time period.
- Select a national park.

Myself:
- <mark>Fund the trip.</mark>
- Book transportation.
- Book lodging.
- <mark>Explore activities.</mark>
</Figure>

### Step 4: Select deliverables

Each participant should spend 5 minutes making a list of deliverables (solutions) for each of the selected impacts in Step 3. Ask:

> How will you help the actors make the intended impact?

Come together as a group and share the lists. Use dot voting to select one to three deliverables for the next step.

<Figure label="Example deliverables by impact">
Be motivated and excited:
- Watch relevant National Geographic documentaries.
- <mark>Borrow relevant books from the library.</mark>
- Take day-trips to local parks.
- Obtain and try hiking equipment.

Fund the trip:
- Estimate expenses.
- Put aside money.
- Reduce expenses.

Explore activities:
- Hiking trails
- Major towns
- "Rainy day" options
- Museums
</Figure>

### Step 5: Select experiments

Each participant should spend 5 minutes making a list of experiments (research or evidence) for each of the selected deliverables in Step 4. Ask:

> How can you test whether the deliverable will have the intended impact?

Come together as a group and share the lists. Use dot voting to select one to three experiments for the next step.

### Step 6: Compose the impact map

As a group, take the lists in Steps 2 through 5 and compose them as an impact map. This can be in the form of an outline. Order every item in the list by which actor, impact, deliverable, or experiment will be the most important toward achieving the goal.

Feel free to later expand, refine, and tweak the impact map as desired. To keep track of the work, append the current status to each deliverable (due date or done date) or experiment (success or failure).

<ImpactMapFigure label="Example impact map">
- **Goal:** Visit a national park this year with my family.
	- **Actor:** My family
		- **Impact:** Be motivated and excited.
			- **Deliverable:** Borrow relevant books from the library. <span class="u-nowrap">(Done Oct 25.)</span>
				- **Experiment:** Ask everyone about what they learned from the books; what more they want to learn before the trip; and what they want to see or do during the trip. (Success!)
	- **Actor:** Myself
		- **Impact:** Fund the trip.
		- **Impact:** Explore activities.
</ImpactMapFigure>

## Exercise: Discover the goal

 Sometimes the goal is unclear or not well defined at the start of the project. In a roundabout way, the goal can be revealed by starting with a potential deliverable. Once the goal is clear, an impact map can be started which can reveal any number of additional deliverables that support the goal.

 ### Step 1: Select a deliverable

Select a deliverable from a predefined list.

<Figure label="Example deliverables">
1. Reusable straw
1. Book about crafting fairy houses for your landscape `++`
1. <mark>Community garden</mark> `+++++++`
1. Solar powered wristwatch
1. Inflatable paddle board `+`
1. Electric wood chipper `+`
1. Billboard ad
1. Airless vehicle tire `++`
1. Self cleaning cat litter box `+++`
1. Wheelchair-friendly picnic table `+`
1. Historical film about the people of the Polynesian islands `++`
1. Self-healing concrete `+++`
</Figure>

### Step 2: Ask why

Take 10 minutes to ask "why" the selected deliverable is worth the investment. Ask it several times to find the underlying motivation.

<Figure label="Example responses">
- Strengthen ties within community
	- Could lead to new connections
	- Fun family activity
- Provide produce for those less fortunate
	- Fight hunger
	- Lack of access to quality, affordable, and fresh fruits and vegetables
	- Fresh vegetables taste better and are often healthier than canned or frozen
	- Seeds cost little, while the value of vegetables is higher
- Build community and pride in the local community
	- Improves the economic prospects of the local community
	- Builds resilience and self-sufficiency
	- Can create connection with local and area government/administration that provides political power to residents participating in garden
- Bring people together in a safe environment
- Teach nutrition and health concepts
	- Improves the health of the community
- Teach children about nature and growing
	- Lack of opportunity
	- Lifelong skill
- Gardening for folks without the space or resources to do so
	- Gardening can be a healthy hobby (activity, Vitamin D)
- Allows purpose and energy for area that is otherwise dormant
	- May improve youth prospects by directing energy into more positive activities
- Provides produce for sale
	- Proceeds can support other community goals.
	- Could provide non-GMO produce alternatives.

### Step 3: Identify themes

Review the "why" responses and identify themes.

<Figure label="Example themes">
- Food access
- Nutrition
- Education
- Community
</Figure>

### Step 4: Explore SMART criteria

Based on the responses in Steps 2 and 3, take 10 minutes to explore different aspects of the SMART criteria: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based.

<Figure label="Example SMART criteria">
- Specific
	- Families in poverty
	- Located downtown
	- Meal
- Measurable
	- Number of people or families who will receive food
	- Number of food varieties
	- Amount harvested
	- Reduce travel time for those receiving donations
	- Number of meals made by fresh food
- Achievable
	- Interest from local sponsors and volunteers
	- City has undeveloped parcels
	- Seeds are affordable
- Relevant
	- Lack of nutritous food access
	- Local groceries have below average food variety
- Time-based
	- Growing season
</Figure>

### Step 5: Make a goal

Transform the SMART criteria explored in Step 4 as a goal.

<Figure label="Example goal">
Provide all families below the poverty line in the local downtown area with one free and nutritious meal per week during this next year's growing season.
</Figure>

### Step 5: Make an impact map

Now, come full-circle and [make an impact map](#exercise-make-an-impact-map) based on the goal in Step 5. The selected deliverable in Step 1 could be included as a deliverable in this new impact map.

## Conclusion

With some structure and prompts, individuals or teams can explore a world of possibilities. With the [*make an impact map* exercise](#exercise-make-an-impact-map), a goal can lead to an abundance of solutions. With the [*discover the goal* exercise](#exercise-discover-the-goal), a vague solution can lead to defining the goal and uncovering even better options.
