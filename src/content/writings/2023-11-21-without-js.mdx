The software teams I have worked with over the last 10 years have primarily developed single-page applications (SPA). That is a long time to practice and learn from that pattern. Two years ago, I published the article [*Warning signs of front-end complexity*](/2022-08-30/complexity) as a way to reflect on the problems encountered with this approach and to provide a way forward. Since then, I directed two software teams on migrating their single-page architecture to a multi-page architecture.

During these projects, developers frequently ask me about the user interface:

> Should this be a link or a button?

My most effective response is simply:

> How would you build this if you could not use JavaScript?

A JavaScript-less web relies on links and form submissions to handle all interactions with the server, resulting in a page refresh or redirect. Let's review some examples:

- [Links](#links)
- [In-page links](#in-page-links)
- [Submit buttons](#submit-buttons)
- [Non-submit buttons](#non-submit-buttons)

## Links

Use links when user input is not needed, such as for a website's navigation.

<CodeFigure label="Primary navigation">
```html
<nav aria-label="Primary">
	<a href="/">Home</a>
	<a href="/search">Search</a>
	<a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
```
</CodeFigure>

If a page links to itself, it may include extra data in its query string to support dynamic server-side rendering. For example, `page` and `sort` keys could provide basic pagination functionality.

<CodeFigure label="Pagination on Page 2 of the search page">
```html
<nav aria-label="Pagination">
	<a href="/search?page=1&sort=asc">
		Page 1
	</a>
	<a href="/search?page=2&sort=asc" aria-current="page">
		Page 2
	</a>
	<a href="/search?page=3&sort=asc">
		Page 3
	</a>
</nav>
```
</CodeFigure>

Links can also be used to apply settings for a page. Like pagination, changing the sort order uses the `page` and `sort` keys.

<CodeFigure label="Change sort order on the search page">
```html
<nav aria-label="Sort">
	<a href="/search?page=1&sort=asc" aria-current="true">
		Sort A to Z
	</a>
	<a href="/search?page=1&sort=desc">
		Sort Z to A
	</a>
</nav>
```
</CodeFigure>

The server inspects the current `sort` value in the URL and dynamically applies it to all the pagination links.

<CodeFigure label="Pagination after changing the sort order from ascending to descending">
```html
<nav aria-label="Pagination">
	<a href="/search?page=1&sort=desc" aria-current="page">
		Page 1
	</a>
	<a href="/search?page=2&sort=desc">
		Page 2
	</a>
	<a href="/search?page=3&sort=desc">
		Page 3
	</a>
</nav>
```
</CodeFigure>

## In-page links

Use in-page links with `#` in the `href` value to navigate to specific content on the same page. This is commonly used for:

- table of contents for pages with many distinct sections
- skip links at the top of the page for keyboard users
- back-to-top link (`#` or `#top`) at the bottom of a long page

<CodeFigure label="Table of contents">
```html
<nav aria-label="Contents">
	<a href="#section-1">…</a>
	<a href="#section-2">…</a>
	<a href="#section-3">…</a>
</nav>

<h2 id="#section-1">…</h2>
<!-- Content -->

<h2 id="#section-2">…</h2>
<!-- Content -->

<h2 id="#section-3">…</h2>
<!-- Content -->
```
</CodeFigure>

<CodeFigure label="Skip and back-to-top links">
```html
<nav aria-label="Skip">
	<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>
	<a href="#results">Skip to results</a>
</nav>

<main id="main">
	<!-- Content -->

	<section id="results">
		<!-- Content -->
	</section>

	<a href="#">Back to top</a>
</main>
```
</CodeFigure>

## Submit buttons

Use submit buttons with forms when user input is needed. The `name` and `value` attributes on form fields are sent to the server on submit.

Use a form's `get` method to change the view of a page based on user input, such as displaying a list of items sorted in a user-specified way. In this particular case, the result is effectively identical to the previously described link-based solution.

<CodeFigure label="Form for changing the sort order">
```html
<form method="get" action="/search">
	<label for="sort-field">Sort</label>
	<select id="sort-field" name="sort">
		<option value="asc">A to Z</option>
		<option value="desc">Z to A</option>
	</select>
	<button type="submit">Sort</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

Use a form's `post` method to create, update, or delete resources. Hidden input fields can indicate the particular action to take on the given resource.

<CodeFigure label={`Forms for creating, updating, and deleting an "Item" resource`}>
```html
<!-- Create -->
<form action="/items" method="post">
	<input name="action" type="hidden" value="create">
	<label for="field-1">Item</label>
	<input id="field-1" name="label" type="text">
	<button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>

<!-- Update -->
<form action="/items" method="post">
	<input name="action" type="hidden" value="update">
	<input name="id" type="hidden" value="123">
	<label for="field-2">Item</label>
	<input
		id="field-2"
		name="label"
		type="text"
		value="…"
	>
	<button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

<!-- Delete -->
<form action="/items" method="post">
	<input name="action" type="hidden" value="delete">
	<input name="id" type="hidden" value="123">
	<button type="submit">Delete</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

Alternatively, the hidden input fields could be replaced by a URL convention that includes the action and resource identifier in the form's `action` URL.

<CodeFigure label="Forms for creating, updating, and deleting a resource without hidden inputs">
```html
<!-- Create -->
<form method="post" action="/items/new">
	<label id="field-1">Item</label>
	<input id="field-1" name="label" type="text">
	<button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>

<!-- Update -->
<form method="post" action="/items/123/edit">
	<label for="field-2">Item</label>
	<input
		id="field-2"
		name="label"
		type="text"
		value="Get groceries"
	>
	<button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>

<!-- Delete -->
<form method="post" action="/items/123/delete">
	<button type="submit">Delete</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

## Non-submit buttons

Buttons do not submit a form when they are:

- outside a form
- within a form with the `type="button"` attribute

<CodeFigure label="Buttons without submit behavior">
```html
<button>Clear</button>

<form>
	<button type="button">Cancel</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

The only way to make these types of buttons functional is to use JavaScript. Prefer to use these for non-critical functionality, that enhances the user experience. For example, a "Clear" button could be a one-click convenience for clearing a text field. If the button fails to work for whatever reason, the user can still manually clear it with the keyboard.

## Conclusion

How you use links or buttons primarily depends on the need for user input and the intended default browser behavior.

| User input | Default behavior | Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| None | Redirect | `<a href="/…">` |
| None | Skip | `<a href="#…">` |
| Optional | Redirect | `<button type="submit">` |
| None | None (use JavaScript) | `<button type="button">` |

It is safer and more maintainable to align as much as possible with default browser behavior. Only override defaults with JavaScript if it will enhance the user experience. Some examples:

- Prevent a form from submitting in order to provide custom client-side validation.
- Use a button instead of making a `div` behave as a button, as this would waste development time and lead to usability and accessibility issues.
