The software teams I work with at Indiana University have primarily developed single-page applications (SPA) over the last 10 years. That is a long period of time to practice that pattern and learn from it. Two years ago, I published the article [*Warning signs of front-end complexity*](/2022-08-30/complexity) as a way to reflect on the problems encountered with this approach and to provide a way forward. Since then, I directed two software teams on migrating their single-page architecture to a multi-page architecture.

During these projects, developers frequently ask me:

> Should this be a link or a button?

My most effective response is simply:

> How would you build this if you could not use JavaScript?

A JavaScript-less web relies on links and form submissions to handle all interactions with the server, resulting in a page refresh or redirect.

Keys and values are shared to the server through the URL's query string.

<CodeFigure>
```html
<a href="/search?page=1&sort=desc">Page 1</a>
<a href="/search?page=2&sort=desc">Page 2</a>

<form method="get" action="/search?sort=desc">
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

Keys and values can also be shared to the server through form field `name` and `value` attributes.

<CodeFigure>
```html
<form method="post">
	<input type="text" name="query">
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

## Create

Use a form to create a resource.

<CodeFigure>
```html
<form method="post" action="/tasks/add">
	<input type="text" name="label" value="">
	<button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

## Update

Use a form to update a resource.

<CodeFigure>
```html
<form method="post" action="/tasks/123">
	<input type="text" name="label" value="Get groceries">
	<button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

## Delete

Use a form to delete a resource.

<CodeFigure>
```html
<form method="post" action="/tasks">
	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="123">
	<button type="submit">Delete task</button>
</form>
```
</CodeFigure>

- Links get complicated when they are used to do things meant for forms.
- Forms get complicated when they are used to do things meant for links.
- GET/POST/DELETE?
- View/Update/Delete?
- Pagination: List of links is more sensible than a bunch of forms.
- Without JavaScript, user input can only be captured with form fields. You can't dynamically update a link's URL to make it work in the same way.
- Progressive enhancement
- JavaScript can make anything in HTML be effectly anything else in HTML. A button could be created from a link. A link could be created from a button. Either could be created from a `div`. However, just because we can doesn't mean we should.
