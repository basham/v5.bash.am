The words product teams use in their software should be intentional. These words should solve problems instead of create them.

UX writing is the practice of using words to solve problems in digital products. As the book [*Strategic Writing for UX* (2019)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strategic-writing-for/9781492049388/) explains:

> We need words is not the problem that we solve as UX writers. We communicate. We invite action. We inspire loyalty. Our teams need to know that UX writing can be used to solve problems.

You don't have to be a "designer" or a "writer" to practice UX writing. Any team member who has influence over the words that are used or how they are used shares the responsibility.

The book summarizes the writing process:

> Writing UX text is iterative, starting with less-than-perfect words, then replacing those words with slightly better words, and repeating until you find the best words.

## Writing should be useful, usable, kind

In this workshop, we will learn through examples and activities how to make the writing we use in digital products to be useful, usable, and kind.

Useful writing is…

1. Purposeful

Usable writing is…

2. Accessible
3. Navigable
4. Clear
5. Concise

Kind writing is…

6. Helpful
7. Inclusive
8. Conversational

## Useful writing is purposeful

Many goals can't be solved alone. Individuals may need to work together to meet their respective or shared goals. Working together requires a meaningful exchange of information or resources and cooperation.

### Meaningful exchange

Between people, this exchange happens through verbal or written conversation.

> Person ⇄ (Conversation) ⇄ Person

Between a person and a digital system, this exchange happens through a user interface, such as an app or website.

> Person ⇄ (Interface) ⇄ System

As such, we can use our daily experience talking with other people as a guide for the writing we use in our digital systems.

The more you know about another person, the more effective your conversation. You should identify who they are to you, learn more about them, and speak to them in a relatable way. In terms of a user interface:

1. **Identify your audience:** Don't write for a "general audience." If your website is meant for college students, think about where they are in their journey. Are they prospective students, enrolled, or alumni? Are they first generation college students? Get specific enough while not excluding anyone within your intended audience.
2. **Research your audience:** Ask questions to learn about your audience's knowledge, expertise, interests, concerns, needs, tasks, and goals.
3. **Write for your audience:** Write in a way to help your audience find the content they need, understand that content, and then use that content to meet their goals.

### Cooperation

Because you know your audience, you can be cooperative and make the conversation easy for them. You can reduce the required effort or upfront knowledge they need to engage in the exchange. Ultimately, each person should be satisfied with what they invested in the conversation and what resulted from the conversation.

In this example at a restaurant, the waiter states upfront the options available to the customer. The customer can provide a simple response by selecting one of those options.

> **Waiter:** Would you like wheat bread or gluten-free bread?
>
> **Customer:** Wheat, please.
>
> **Waiter:** Great.

In contrast, an uncooperative salesperson could frustrate a customer and cost them extra time and effort.

> **Customer:** Can you call me when this furniture is back in stock?
>
> **Salesperson:** No.
>
> **Customer:** Then what should I do?
>
> **Salesperson:** Check back later.



## Mutual benefits

- Person reads The Home Depot's  
[*How to Hang Drywall* guide](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ah/how-to-hang-drywall/9ba683603be9fa5395fab90cbb4826d).
- Person purchases related products.

Now for an example with a system. A home owner wants to hang drywall for the first time. This requires knowledge, materials, and tools. They discover Home Depot has an online guide to walk through this project with videos and written instructions. They've gained knowledge, but the page also lists the materials and tools that they may need. These product pages then display where to find the product in the customer's local store. In summary, the store aims to gain a loyal customer (and their money) by making it easy for the customer to learn about and complete their projects. Both the customer and the store benefit by this exchange.

## Share your experience

- **Who:** Person and person/system
- **What:** Working together
- **Why:** Achieve goals

Now, I'd like to hear from you. Think about an experience you've had or know about, that involves a person and another person or a person and a system. How are they trying to work together to achieve their respective goals? Did that work out?
