The book [*Born to Run* (2009)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run_(McDougall_book)) introduced me to the idea of running with sandals.

In 2010, I started to train my body in "barefoot" style running with [Vibram](https://www.vibram.com/) FiveFingers. Over the years, I transitioned full-time to sandals. I cobbled my first pair with a kit from [Luna Sandals](https://lunasandals.com/) and visited their factory in Seattle.

I next experimented with [Xero Shoes](https://xeroshoes.com/), attracted by their adaptability and affordability.

I now buy from [Deliberate Life Designs](https://www.deliberatelifedesigns.com/). They are a small business specializing in high-quality custom orders. My feet have never been happier.
