Follow me on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/basham) to see that I back too many games.

## Favorite game publishers

- [Gamelyn Games](https://www.gamelyngames.com/) makes the Tiny Epic series. These are small-sized games that play big on a table. They have excellent solo modes, scale to four or five players, and play in about an hour.
- [Button Sky Games](https://buttonshygames.com/) makes quick-to-play wallet-sized games, for one to two players.
- [Sinister Fish Games](https://sinisterfish.com/) share a gorgeous aesthetic, with quality materials.

## Favorite games

- [*Tiny Epic Dungeons* (2021)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/331787/tiny-epic-dungeons) is a dungeon crawler, with great mechanics. It also got me into painting minifigures.
- [*Wingspan* (2019)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan) is well balanced, beautiful, and educational.

## Most impactful games

- [*Settlers of Catan* (1995)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) made me realize games could be significantly more entertaining than Monopoly, Risk, or Scrabble.
- [*Risk* (1959)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181/risk) was played continuously in high school during breaks throughout the school day. In the iOS version, games would last ten minutes instead of hours. I realized in dismay that strategy and decision making was a miniscule part of the gameplay, as most of the time requirement was set up, rolling the dice, moving pieces, and waiting on other players. Since then, I vowed to find more interesting games and be more sensitive to game mechanics.
