<div class="fs-2">
I grew up, studied, and live in southern Indiana. I believe every [word, byte, and pixel](/purpose) can improve how we care for each other and the earth.
</div>

During my formidable years, I dabbled in the web, coding, graphic design, and [journalism](https://v2.bash.am/portfolio/reitz-journalism/).

Starting in my late undergraduate studies, I collaborated with [Tony Dewan](https://www.tonydewan.com) on various interactive art installations:

- [Ping Platform](https://v3.bash.am/portfolio/ping-platform/) (2008)
- [Waterwall](https://v3.bash.am/portfolio/waterwall/) (2009)
- [Balloon Park](http://www.balloonpark.org) (2013)

Those projects inspired me to stretch my design skills beyond the confines of a browser or a printed page. I continued on to a graduate degree, where I learned interaction design, user research, and how to work in teams.

My [capstone project](https://oncheckin.bash.am) (2011) became the check-in and membership tool for a [local running community](http://www.bfh3.com). The latest active implementation is the web app [OnCheckIn](https://oncheck.in).

My brother [Nick Basham](https://nickbasham.com) and I pivoted the idea of OnCheckIn into a new service called Rundwn (2012), which tracked long distance running relays. Over that year, the start up life taught me about managing client relationships and business concerns.

I currently work as a senior user experience designer for [Indiana University](https://uits.iu.edu), focusing on custom enterprise web software for students, faculty, and staff. In this role, I frequently:

- contribute to the [Rivet Design System](https://rivet.uits.iu.edu) (more on [design systems](/design-systems))
- [write](/notes) articles for and participate in the [user experience community of practice](https://ux.iu.edu)
- [speak](/talks) and run workshops at the [Statewide IT Conference](https://statewideit.iu.edu)
- [mentor](/mentoring) interns, graduate assistants, designers, and developers
- steer standards for design, front-end development, and accessibility practices

Feel free to [get in touch](/contact).
