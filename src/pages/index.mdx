I'm Chris Basham, a user experience designer and front-end developer
in Bloomington, Indiana. I have 12 years of [professional experience](/resume) in web software, accessibility, [reactive programming](/reactive-programming), [design systems](/design-systems), mentoring, and public speaking. I believe every word, byte, and pixel is an opportunity to improve how a product or system is experienced.

Outside of work, I play [board games](/board-games), listen to [audiobooks](/books) and [podcasts](/podcasts), and run trails in sandals.

Email me at chris@bash.am. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chrisbasham), [GitHub](https://github.com/basham), and [CodePen](https://codepen.io/basham).
