I'm Chris, a designer and front-end developer for [Indiana University](https://uits.iu.edu/) in [Bloomington](https://www.visitbloomington.com/). I work on a cross-functional Agile team, building enterprise web software for students, advisors, and faculty. I'm interested in accessibility, [reactive programming](/about#reactive-programming) and [design systems](/about#design-systems).
