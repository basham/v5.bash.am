I have mentored interns, graduate assistants, designers, and developers. I approach each relationship differently.

## Interns

- Interns need ongoing support, as they may not have much prior experience in the field.
- Establish some goals at the start of the internship. [Impact maps](/2023-10-31/impact) are useful for framing goals, documenting accomplishments, and prioritizing work.
- Collaborate with the intern about establishing a pace for their learning and practice.

## Graduate assistants

- Graduate assistants tend to have an academic foundation in their field. Work projects put into practice what they've learned in the classroom.
- Critique and exposure to other full-time staff in their field help them refine their craft.

## Designers

- Weekly meetings with a group of designers can provide diverse feedback for members.
- One-on-one meetings with another designer can produce a safe space for richer feedback.

## Developers

- Backend developers must learn new syntaxes, tools, and methods for the front-end. Paired programming is a great way to teach while solving practical problems.
