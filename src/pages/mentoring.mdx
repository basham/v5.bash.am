I have mentored interns, graduate assistants, designers, and developers. Each relationship is approached differently.

## Interns

Interns need ongoing support, as they may not have much prior experience in the field. At the start of the internship, you should establish some goals. Impact maps are useful for framing goals, documenting accomplishments, and prioritizing work. Collaborate with the intern about establishing a pace for their learning and practice.

## Graduate assistants

Graduate assistants tend to have an academic foundation in their field. Work projects put into practice what they've learned in the classroom. Critique and exposure to other full-time staff in their field help them refine their craft.

## Designers

Weekly meetings with a group of designers can provide diverse feedback for members. One-on-one meetings with another designer can produce a safe space for richer feedback.

## Developers

Backend developers must learn new syntaxes, tools, and methods for the front-end. Paired programming is a great way to teach while solving practical problems.
