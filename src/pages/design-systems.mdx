Around 2013, the Kuali Foundation was a partnership of universities. They worked together to build open source web services. I started a [UI pattern library](https://v4.bash.am/work/ks-design-guide) for the student initiative. This established standards and best practices for several product teams. This project taught me about maintenance, versioning, documentation, governance, and political buy-in.

A year later, I started a React component library for a suite of apps at Indiana University. The university's [accessibility experts](https://atac.iu.edu/) vetted these components. The icon set composed of custom and open source icons. I [systematically adapted](https://v4.bash.am/articles/codifying-colors/) the [color palette](https://v4.bash.am/work/iu-color-palette) from the university's brand colors. The product teams integrated the library into a half-dozen apps over two years.

In 2016, a new design office established the university-wide [Rivet Design System](https://rivet.iu.edu/). I've been a regular [contributor to Rivet](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/graphs/contributors). In 2021, I lead the [initial release](https://rivet.iu.edu/blog/rivet-icons-1-0-0-release/) of the [icon set](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-icons), which supplied Rivet with its first custom element.
