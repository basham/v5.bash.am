## Most impactful books

Some books have made a profound impact on my life.

- [*Born to Run* (2009)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Born-to-Run-Audiobook/B002V8KTYG) alongside local running groups transformed running from something I "had" to do, to something I loved to do.
- [*How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way* (1984)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671530771/) led to countless hours sketching during my early years. It instilled a passion for drawing and ultimately design.

## Favorite audiobooks

The best audiobooks perfectly pair the narrator to the author.

- [*Off to Be the Wizard* (2013)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Off-to-Be-the-Wizard-Audiobook/B00IIS32NI) and the [Magic 2.0 book series](https://www.audible.com/series/Magic-20-Audiobooks/B00MQ2WZIK) is silly and nerdy, with a ton of silly and nerdy characters.
- [*Orconomics* (2014)](https://www.audible.com/pd/Orconomics-A-Satire-Audiobook/B01NBM9OC1) and the *Dark Profit Saga* follows such a fun mismatch team of characters, that I wish I was more into RPG games.
